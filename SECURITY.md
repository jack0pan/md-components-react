# Security Policy

If you discover a security issue in Material Components for React, please report it by reporting a [issuse](https://github.com/jack0pan/md-components-react/issues/new/choose) on github.

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make Material Components safe for everyone.
